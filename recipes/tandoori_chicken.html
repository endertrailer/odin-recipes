    <h1>recipe for tandoori chicken</h1>
    <p><h2>
        Try this authentic tandoori chicken that's marinated in yogurt and spices, then cooked on the grill instead of a clay oven so you can make it at home. Serve
        with long-grain basmati rice, grilled veggies, roasted corn on the cob, and a cucumber salad.
    </h2></p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
    <h3>
    <li>2 pounds chicken, cut into pieces</li>
    <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups plain yogurt</li>
    <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon red food coloring (Optional)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon yellow food coloring (Optional)</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped cilantro</li>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
    <h3>
    <li>Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. Cut slits into meat 
        and place into a shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with lemon juice and salt. 
        Let sit for 20 minutes.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food coloring. Spread yogurt mixture
        over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours (the longer the better).
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high 
        heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade. Discard remaining marinade.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the 
        bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with cilantro and lemon wedges.
    </li>
